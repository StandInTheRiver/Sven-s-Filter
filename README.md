All items fall into a standardized coloring scheme to make hype and excitment easy to understand and consistent. If something drops thats red, you know its value right away.
No more getting excited for stormshields that are worth 3 wss unless you slam 3 sockets. additionally, no more special tags for new items that are worth jack shit
In order from Most hype to lease hype

Rainbow - GG items that are either worth at least 1hr as is, or when slammed become incredibly expensive. You should always be happy when you see rainbows on your screen
Red - Items that range in value from 0.25 up to 0.99 hr, also includes items that CAN be worth insane amounts of high runes (think unique rings)
Purple -Items that are considered liquid currency, anything that is purple is going to be at least the value of a wss or more, up to gul
Orange -Items that in 99% of cases, you should always be collecting and picking up. 
Gold - Uniques, all uniques are gold with the exceptions of GG dclone/rathma gear and Extremely valuable gear
Green - Set items are always green
Yellow - Is used for rare items that have otherwise not been moved to another tier. these are items you'll pick up sometimes to ID and can in very rare cases roll very high value mods
Blue - Magic items, there are only a few blue items in this filter that are shown most of the time, crafting bases that are magic remain blue
White - Bases, items that have zero or many sockets that are bases for runewords are white
Gray - no items are colored grey, the grey text is reserved for the Etheral tag which is appended to the start of an items name if it is etheral


If you see a rainbow - you know you have found something very special and worth hrs
if you see red, it means you have found something rare and usually worth half an hr
if you see something purple, it means you have found something worth a low amount of hr but will likely sell
if you see something orange - you pick it up, these items can be worth hrs in bulk or with good mods
if you see something yellow - it means it could be worth something with the correct rolls
if you see something blue, it means its a crafting base or a niche item that sometimes has good rolls
if you see something gray - its etheral
if you see something green - its a set item

All unique and set items have there names hard coded on drop - no longer do you have to guess or remember what an item might be
set items have been simplified to tell you exactly what slot it is - example "natalyas mark is now labled natalys weapon



Special thanks to Kryszard - i used his filter as a base
