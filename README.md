All items fall into a standardized coloring scheme to make hype and excitment easy to understand and consistent. If something drops thats red, you know its value right away.
No more getting excited for stormshields that are worth 3 wss unless you slam 3 sockets. additionally, no more special tags for new items that are worth jack shit

In order from Most hype to lease hype:

Rainbow - GG items that are either worth at least 1hr as is, or when slammed become incredibly expensive. You should always be happy when you see rainbows on your screen

Red - Items that range in value from 0.25 up to 0.99 hr, also includes items that CAN be worth insane amounts of high runes (think unique rings, facets ect...)

Purple -Items that are considered liquid currency, anything that is purple is going to be at least the value of a wss or more, up to gul

Orange -Items that in 99% of cases, you should always be collecting and picking up and accummulate into currency.

Gold - Uniques, all uniques are gold with the exceptions of GG dclone/rathma gear and Extremely valuable gear

Green - Set items are always green

Yellow - Is used for rare items that have otherwise not been moved to another tier. these are items you'll pick up sometimes to ID and can in very rare cases roll very high value mods

Blue - Magic items, there are only a few blue items in this filter that are shown most of the time

White - Bases, items that have zero or many sockets that are bases for runewords are white

Gray - no items are colored grey, the grey text is reserved for the Etheral tag which is appended to the start of an items name if it is etheral


All unique and set items have there names hard coded on drop - no longer do you have to guess or remember what an item might be
set items have been simplified to tell you exactly what slot it is - example "natalyas mark is now labled natalys weapon
All items display there quality, (normal, exceptional, elite) to let you know what base the item is.
Many modern loot filter settings have been implemented here including gheeds gambling screen, recipe notes, tri res boots tag, charms ect...



Special thanks to Kryszard - i used his filter as a base
